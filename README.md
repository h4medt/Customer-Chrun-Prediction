# Customer-Chrun-Prediction
A comprehensive project employing artificial neural networks to predict customer churn, helping businesses understand and mitigate reasons for customer loss.

Project Highlights:
	•	Objective: Analyze and predict which customers are likely to leave a service using a dataset of telecom customer behavior.
	•	Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib.
	•	Process:
	1.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and encoded data, handling missing values and categorical features with techniques like one-hot encoding.
	2.	Feature Scaling: Applied Min-Max Scaling to normalize continuous variables.
	3.	Neural Network Design: Built and trained a model using TensorFlow with layers for input, hidden computations, and binary classification.
	4.	Evaluation: Assessed model performance using precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
	5.	Visualization: Generated histograms to explore correlations between tenure, charges, and churn rates.
