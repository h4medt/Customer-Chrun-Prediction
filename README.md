# Customer Churn Prediction  

A comprehensive project employing artificial neural networks to predict customer churn, helping businesses understand and mitigate reasons for customer loss.  

---

### **Project Highlights:**  

**Objective:**  
Analyze and predict which customers are likely to leave a service using a dataset of telecom customer behavior.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

**Process:**  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and encoded data.  
   - Handled missing values and categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding.  

2. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Applied Min-Max Scaling to normalize continuous variables.  

3. **Neural Network Design**  
   - Built and trained a model using TensorFlow.  
   - Included layers for input, hidden computations, and binary classification.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Assessed model performance using precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification reports.  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Generated histograms to explore correlations between tenure, charges, and churn rates.
